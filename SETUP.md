# Template

This is a VanillaWC project starter template. It contains everything needed to start building a new component.

To add per-project customizations

- Open `Edit` -> `Find in Files`
- Enable the `Use Regular Expressions` option
- Search for `\{\{\w+\}\}`

That will locate every string that needs to be replaced to ready this template. Once that's done, delete this file.
